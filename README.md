#Under-graduate final year project. 
## Music Host Interface
The goal for this project was to combine the features of a Jukebox and
the role that a DJ plays. This combination is what I have titled as the
Music Host Interface. It defines two roles, the Music Host which consists
of a desktop application and the Music Guest which consists of an
Android application.

    The scope of this project was primarily based on interf acing these two
elements together into one cohesive solution using the follo wing
technologies, Bluetooth, Cloud database, and JavaFX.

    The approach for this project consisted of dividing up the work to be
completed into 9 sprints that each required incremental degrees of
functionality to be achieved. The following two paragraphs are a
summary of what was achieved from using this approach.

    Using the graphical user interface the Music Host has the following
abilities. The first is the ability to dictate what the guests can or can't do
to suit their own hosting preferences. The second is the ability to play
music to the guests. The third is the ability to login and gain access to
their own private selection of songs from anywhere around the world that
has a Music Host I nterface. This is achieved due to the fact that the
host's private login credentials and songs are stored on a cloud
database.

    Using the Android Application the guest has the following abilities. The
first is the ability to choose a song to play from the host's selection of
songs. The second is the ability to request a song from the host in the
form a text message. The third is the ability to veto the current song.
